            <h2>Question 1</h2>
            <p>Steps I would take to complete the task</p>
			
			<p><h4>Step 1: Gather Requirements</h4>

			Meet with the company to understand their goals, target audience, and specific requirements for the website.
			Discuss the type of products and services they offer and how they want them to be presented on the site.
			Gather any branding guidelines, logos, and content they want to include.</p>
			
<p><h4>Step 2: Plan the Website Structure</h4>

		Create a sitemap or outline that defines the structure of the website. In this case, you need three main pages (Home, Products/Services, Contact) and an additional page for answering a question.</p>
<p><h4>Step 3: Design the Layout</h4>

		Design a layout for the website, including the placement of navigation menus, header, footer, and content areas.
		Create a mockup to visualize the website's look and feel.</p>
<p><h4>Step 4: Develop the HTML</h4>

		Create separate HTML files for each page of the website (e.g., index.html, products.html, contact.html, question.html).
		Use HTML tags to structure the content on each page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables where necessary.
		Ensure that each page includes a consistent header, navigation menu, footer, and content area.</p>
<p><h4>Step 5: Implement a Style Sheet</h4>

		Create a separate CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file to define the visual styling of the website.
		Link the CSS file to each HTML page to apply the unified theme.
		Use CSS to define fonts, colors, margins, padding, borders, backgrounds, and other styling elements to ensure a consistent design.</p>
<p><h4>Step 6: Add Content</h4>

		Populate each page with relevant content, such as product/service descriptions, images, contact details, and a brief company profile.
		Ensure that the content is well-organized and easy to read.</p>
<p><h4>Step 7: Test and Debug</h4>

		Test the website on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
		Verify that all links, navigation menus, and forms (if any) are working correctly.
		Debug any issues that may arise during testing.</p>

<p><h4>Step 8: Final Review and Client Approval</h4>

		Review the completed website with the client to ensure it meets their expectations.
		Address any feedback or requested changes.</p>
<p><h4>Step 9: Launch</h4>
		Once the client approves the website, it's time to launch it on a web hosting server.
		Configure domain settings and upload the website files to the hosting server.</p>
